Open sourced LSL code of little projects in Second Life:

⦾ WalkToMe.txt = A basic project as proof of concept for the Corrade bot, automating a bunch from a script talking to an automated "scripted agent" account online. Put the edited code for your Corrade bot in an object and click it for the bot to walk towards it. You can also attach the object as a HUD to make the bot follow you.

⦾ animeshcycle.txt = A fun improvement scripting excercise in reducing bitcode where an animesh object can cycle through all it's animations.

⦾ sniffy.txt = listen to a channel for any message that might pass by, define the channel in a text dialog. Ideal as a debug HUD, also on marketplace as "Sniffy HUD".

More to follow, who knows.
